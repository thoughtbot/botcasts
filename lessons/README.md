# ðŸ“• The Lesson Plan

This course works by introducing a series of failing tests that you must get to
pass by introducing Hotwire patterns into the application. Once the tests pass,
move on to the next lesson.

To get started, make sure you've run `./bin/setup`. Then run `./ta/start-lesson
1` to start the first lesson.  Refer to the table of contents below to help
guide you through each lesson.

To list all lessons, run `./ta/list-lessons`. You can jump between lessons at
anytime.
