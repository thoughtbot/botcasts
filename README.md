**Hotwire-powered Podcast Player** 🔌

This course works by introducing a series of failing tests that you must get to
pass by introducing Hotwire patterns into the application. Once the tests pass,
move on to the next lesson.

## ⚙️  Setup

If this is your first time running the application, run `./bin/setup` to
install dependencies and seed the database.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Once you've setup the application locally, you can start the [lesson plan][1].

## 🏗 Local Development

Run `./bin/dev` to start the development server and then navigate to
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
